<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>It'd be great if universities could enroll everybody, but it's not very realistic, is it? Let's refine our algorithm. In this stage, we need to set a threshold of the mean score â€” if the mean score of the applicant is equal to or greater than <code class="java">60.0</code>, the program should notify the applicant of their acceptance to the university. Otherwise, inform them about their rejection.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>At this stage, your program should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the numbers and output the mean score, as in the previous stage. </li>
<li>If the mean score is equal to or greater than <code class="java">60.0</code>, output the following message: <code class="java">Congratulations, you are accepted!</code> </li>
<li>If the mean score is less than <code class="java">60.0</code>, output the following message: <code class="java">We regret to inform you that we will not be able to offer you admission.</code></li>
</ol>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>the applicant is enrolled</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; 70
&gt; 56
&gt; 81
69.0
Congratulations, you are accepted!</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> <em>the applicant is rejected</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; 100
&gt; 43
&gt; 27
56.666666666666664
We regret to inform you that we will not be able to offer you admission.</code></pre>
